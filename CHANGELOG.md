# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.7.0] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed

- **`tools/list` now exposes the full 90-tool catalog** (issue #23). Four
  compounding bugs hid 87 of 90 tools from MCP clients:
  - `NARSIL_ENABLED_CATEGORIES=""` no longer disables every category — empty
    and whitespace-only env values are treated as unset, and empty segments
    inside comma lists are filtered out. The same guard now applies to
    `NARSIL_PRESET` and `NARSIL_DISABLED_TOOLS`.
  - Tool category lookup uses `Display`, not `Debug`, so `ToolCategory::Lsp`
    correctly matches the `LSP` YAML key. Previously LSP-category overrides
    were silently ignored.
  - `EngineOptions` gained `remote_enabled` so `--remote` actually surfaces
    Remote-category tools; `convert_engine_options` now also propagates
    `FeatureFlag::Graph` (under `--features graph`).
  - `max_tool_count` raised from 76 to 128 (with headroom for new tools).
    The Full preset now bypasses the cap entirely — it is an explicit
    "expose everything" directive. Non-Full presets continue to honour the
    budget.
- **Watch mode actually runs** (issue #26). The spawn site dropped the
  shutdown sender immediately, so the watcher's `select!` loop saw `Closed`
  on its first poll and exited milliseconds after startup, silently
  disabling `--watch`. Restructured into `persist::spawn_watch_mode` which
  returns the sender (`#[must_use]`) so the lifetime requirement is now a
  compile-time error class, not a comment.
- **`cargo build --features frontend` succeeds without `frontend/dist`**
  (issue #18b). Added `#[allow_missing = true]` to the `rust-embed` derive
  and a `build.rs` that emits `cargo:warning` pointing the user at
  `cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build` if the dist directory is empty.

### Added

- **Every CLI flag accepts a `NARSIL_*` env var** (issue #21). Enabled
  clap's `env` feature and annotated every flag in `ServerArgs`. Notably:
  `NARSIL_NEURAL_MODEL`, `NARSIL_NEURAL_BACKEND`, `NARSIL_NEURAL_DIMENSION`,
  `NARSIL_REPOS` (comma-separated), `NARSIL_GIT`, `NARSIL_REMOTE`,
  `NARSIL_GRAPH`, `NARSIL_HTTP`, `NARSIL_PRESET`, `NARSIL_INDEX_PATH`, etc.
- **Bare `narsil-mcp` defaults to the current working directory** (issue
  #22 partial). No more empty-repo errors when invoked inside a project
  with no `--repos`. Missing repository paths are filtered out at startup
  with a WARN log naming each one.
- **Native Linux ARM64 release binary** (issue #20). Built on GitHub's
  `ubuntu-24.04-arm` Graviton runner; published as
  `narsil-mcp-vX.Y.Z-linux-aarch64.tar.gz`. The Homebrew tap formula now
  selects this artifact via `Hardware::CPU.arm?` so `brew install` works
  on Raspberry Pi, AWS Graviton, Asahi Linux, and Apple-silicon-via-Docker.

### Tests

- Added 17 new tests across config filter (Lsp Display lookup, Remote/Graph
  propagation, Full-preset bypass, Remote tool visibility, env-var empty
  handling), CLI parsing (every NARSIL_* env var, cwd fallback,
  missing-path filter), watch mode (end-to-end file change → reindex), and
  Java parsing (parser unit + Maven-layout integration test).
- Added a process-wide `ENV_LOCK` mutex in env-var test sites and updated
  six pre-existing `priority_tests` that were race-vulnerable.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- **UTF-8 boundary panic** - Fixed signature truncation in `parser.rs` and `chunking.rs` that could panic when byte offset 200/500 landed inside a multi-byte UTF-8 character (Cyrillic, CJK, emoji). Now uses `floor_char_boundary()` for safe truncation.
- **`.gitignore` respected without `.git`** - Added `.require_git(false)` to `WalkBuilder` so `.gitignore` rules are applied even in projects without a `.git` directory, preventing `node_modules/` from being indexed.

### Added

- **Forgemax integration** - Added `forge.toml` configuration for using narsil-mcp through the [Forgemax](https://github.com/postrv/forgemax) Code Mode gateway, collapsing 90 tools into 2 for significant token savings (~1,000 vs ~12,000 tokens).

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed

- **Crash-proof chunking** - Fixed unsafe byte-level string slicing in `node_text()`, `extract_signature()`, and `parser.rs` signature extraction that panicked when tree-sitter byte positions landed on multi-byte UTF-8 character boundaries (emoji, CJK, accented characters). All byte slicing now uses safe `content.get()` with fallback. This was the root cause of `hybrid_search`, `search_chunks`, and `get_chunk_stats` crashing the MCP server with "Connection closed" when processing repos with multi-byte content.
- **NaN-safe sort operations** - Fixed 5 locations where `partial_cmp().unwrap()` would panic on NaN float values: `search.rs` (BM25 results), `embeddings.rs` (similarity sort), `git.rs` (churn score sort), `index.rs` (relevance score sort), `extract.rs` (relevance sort). All now use `unwrap_or(std::cmp::Ordering::Equal)`.
- **Defense-in-depth chunking** - Added `catch_unwind` wrappers around all three repo-wide `chunk_file()` loops in `hybrid_search`, `search_chunks`, and `get_chunk_stats` so a panic in one file logs a warning and skips it instead of killing the MCP server process.
- **Dependency security** - Updated `time` crate from 0.3.44 to 0.3.47 to fix RUSTSEC-2026-0009 (DoS via stack exhaustion)

### Added

- **Visualization frontend overhaul** - Full single-page application with HashRouter routing, file tree sidebar with syntax-highlighted code viewer (Prism.js), dashboard page with repo picker, and per-repo overview pages with graph view links
- **Graph view performance** - Import graph now uses cached index data instead of filesystem walks; symbol graph iterates file cache directly instead of markdown round-trips; all graph views respect `max_nodes` parameter for early termination
- **Real control flow graphs** - Flow view now uses the real CFG builder (`cfg::analyze_function`) with proper basic blocks, branch conditions, and loop back-edges instead of the single-block stub
- **Hybrid graph budget splitting** - Hybrid view allocates 60/40 node budget between call and import graphs for balanced results
- **Configurable embedding dimensions** ([#14](https://github.com/postrv/narsil-mcp/issues/14)) - Added `--neural-dimension` CLI arg and `default_dimension_for_model()` lookup so models like `text-embedding-3-large` use correct dimensions (3072) instead of hardcoded 1536
- **Nix frontend build** ([#13](https://github.com/postrv/narsil-mcp/issues/13)) - Added `frontendDist` derivation in `flake.nix` using `buildNpmPackage` so `nix profile install github:postrv/narsil-mcp#with-frontend` works
- **Rust security rules** - 18 new language-specific rules (RUST-004 to RUST-021) in `rules/rust.yaml` covering command injection via `Command::new()`, unsafe transmute, FFI boundary issues, TOCTOU race conditions, ReDoS patterns, static mut usage, SSRF via HTTP clients, and more
- **Elixir security rules** - 18 new language-specific rules (EX-001 to EX-018) in `rules/elixir.yaml` covering atom exhaustion, `binary_to_term` deserialization, `Code.eval` injection, Ecto SQL injection, Phoenix XSS, Erlang distribution security, unsafe NIFs
- **Custom frontend favicon** - Frontend now uses narsil-mcp branding icon (`icon.svg`) instead of default Vite logo

### Changed

- **Migrated from `serde_yaml` to `serde-saphyr`** - Deprecated `serde_yaml` (unmaintained) replaced with actively maintained, panic-free `serde-saphyr` YAML library across all config loading, security rules parsing, and CLI commands
- **Test count** increased from 1,611 to 1,763 (+152 tests)

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- **Scope-hint propagation for call graph resolution** - Scoped calls like `App::run()` now extract the scope qualifier (`App`) and use it to disambiguate callees across files. When multiple files define a function with the same name, the scope hint narrows candidates by matching against file paths (e.g., `App` matches `src/app/mod.rs`). Falls back to deterministic alphabetical ordering when ambiguous.

- **Deterministic call graph resolution** - All `find_function()` and `resolve_callee()` methods now collect candidates, sort alphabetically, and pick the first match. Previously, iteration order over `DashMap` was non-deterministic, causing `find_call_path`, `get_callers`, and `get_callees` to return different results across runs.

- **Macro body call extraction** - The call graph builder now extracts function call patterns from inside Rust macro invocations (e.g., `assert!`, `println!`, custom macros), which were previously opaque to analysis.

- **Rust-specific import resolution** - The import graph now correctly resolves `crate::`, `super::`, and `self::` import paths to their corresponding `.rs` or `mod.rs` files, instead of treating them as opaque strings.

### Fixed

- **8 graph analysis bugs** found via real-world testing against the Patina codebase:
  - Call graph nodes now use qualified keys (`file_path::function_name`) instead of bare names, preventing cross-file name collisions
  - `find_function()` returns deterministic results when multiple matches exist
  - `get_hotspots()` filters out generic trait method implementations (`new`, `default`, `from`, `clone`, `fmt`, etc.) that added noise
  - `get_hotspots()` output is capped at 50 results by default to prevent oversized responses
  - `get_code_graph` handler now supports `max_nodes` parameter (default: 200) and truncates with a note when exceeded
  - Import graph node count is capped at 200 to prevent oversized responses
  - CFG builder now correctly handles Rust `expression_statement` nodes wrapping control flow (`if`, `match`, `while`, `for`, `loop`, `return`)
  - CFG builder handles `let` declarations with control-flow RHS (e.g., `let x = if cond { a } else { b }`)
  - Complexity metrics now recognize Rust expression variants (`if_expression`, `for_expression`, `while_expression`, `loop_expression`)
  - Rust `use` import parsing now extracts full module paths instead of truncating at 2 segments

- **Dependency security** - Updated `bytes` crate from 1.11.0 to 1.11.1 to fix RUSTSEC-2026-0007
- **Dependency security** - Updated `time` crate from 0.3.44 to 0.3.47 to fix RUSTSEC-2026-0009 (DoS via stack exhaustion)

### Changed

- **Nix flake improvements** (based on PR #12 by @balaclava-guy):
  - Removed unnecessary macOS framework `buildInputs` (`Security`, `SystemConfiguration`) - stdenv provides these
  - Extracted `mkPkg` helper function to DRY up package definitions
  - Added `cargoTestFlags = ["--lib"]` for nix builds (integration tests require the binary at a fixed path, incompatible with nix sandbox)
  - Added `no-check` and `with-frontend-no-check` package variants
  - Added `git` to devShell packages
  - Updated description to "90 tools across 32 languages"

- **Test count** increased from 1,598 to 1,611

## [1.4.0] - 2025-02-05

### Improved

- **`--graph` flag user experience** - The `--graph` CLI flag now provides clear feedback when used with a binary that wasn't built with `--features graph`:
  - Displays a warning at startup explaining the issue
  - Provides the exact rebuild command needed
  - Logs now accurately report `graph=true` or `graph=false` based on actual feature availability (previously showed `graph=true` even when the feature wasn't compiled)

- **Improved help text** - The `--graph` and `--graph-path` CLI arguments now include notes explaining that the binary must be built with `--features graph` for these flags to have effect

### Documentation

- **README updated** with:
  - Feature Builds section now includes `graph` feature with size estimate (~35MB)
  - New troubleshooting section "Graph Feature Not Working" with clear fix instructions
  - Note in Full Feature Set clarifying `--graph` requires `--features graph` build
  - What's New section updated for v1.4.x

### Technical Details

This change addresses confusion where users would pass `--graph` and the server would appear to start normally, but SPARQL/CCG tools would return errors. The misleading `graph=true` in logs made debugging difficult. Now:
- Users get immediate feedback at startup if there's a mismatch
- The exact fix is provided in the warning message
- Log output accurately reflects what's actually available

## [1.3.1] - 2025-01-23

## [1.1.6] - 2025-01-03

### Fixed

- **C++ parser** - Fixed tree-sitter query syntax for C++ namespace and class declarations. Previously caused parsing errors on C++ codebases.

## [1.1.5] - 2025-01-01

### Fixed

- **`--http` timeout with Zed editor** - The HTTP server and MCP server were mutually exclusive, causing timeouts when `--http` was enabled. Now HTTP server runs in background via `tokio::spawn` while MCP always runs on the main task, allowing both to operate concurrently.

- **`--preset` CLI flag missing** - Added the `--preset` flag that was documented but never implemented. This allows overriding editor-detected presets (e.g., `--preset full` forces all tools on Zed which defaults to minimal).

- **`prompts/get` method not found** - Implemented the MCP `prompts/get` method with full prompt templates for `explain_codebase` and `find_implementation` prompts. Previously only `prompts/list` was implemented.

### Added

- Comprehensive test coverage for CLI preset behavior (6 new tests)
- Test coverage for `prompts/get` functionality (6 new tests)
- Test coverage for HTTP/MCP concurrent operation pattern (6 new tests)

### Changed

- Documentation updated to clarify `--http` runs alongside MCP (not instead of)
- Added Scoop installation note about optional features (ONNX, frontend) requiring source build

## [1.1.1] - 2025-12-28

### Added

- **Package manager distribution** - Making installation easier across all platforms:
  - **Homebrew tap** for macOS/Linux (`brew install postrv/narsil/narsil-mcp`)
  - **crates.io** publishing automated in release workflow (`cargo install narsil-mcp`)
  - **AUR packages** for Arch Linux (`narsil-mcp` and `narsil-mcp-bin`)
  - **Scoop bucket** for Windows (`scoop install narsil-mcp`)
- **GitHub releases** now include versioned tarballs (`.tar.gz` for Unix, `.zip` for Windows)
- **SHA256 checksums** generated for all release artifacts
- **Comprehensive installation guide** (`docs/INSTALL.md`) with platform-specific instructions

### Changed

- Release workflow now creates versioned tarballs instead of individual binaries
- `install.sh` updated to download versioned tarballs with proper extraction

### Fixed

- Windows CI test failure (`test_claude_code_path`) - now handles both `HOME` and `USERPROFILE` env vars
- Tree-sitter query warnings for TypeScript/TSX (changed `identifier` to `type_identifier` for class names)
- Tree-sitter query warning for Kotlin (removed unsupported `interface_declaration` node)
- Neural API key warning message now suggests running `narsil-mcp config init --neural` for better user experience
- Version string in startup logs now uses `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` instead of hardcoded value

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-28

### 🎯 Major Features - Tool Selection & Configuration System

**Solves:** "76 tools? Isn't that much too many? About how many tokens does Narsil add to the context window with this many tools enabled?" - [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/)

narsil-mcp v1.1.0 introduces an intelligent tool selection and configuration system that dramatically reduces context window usage while maintaining full backwards compatibility.

### Added

### Token Usage Savings

Real-world impact on context window usage:

| Preset | Tools | JSON Size | Tokens | Reduction |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Minimal | 26 | 18.3 KB | ~4,686 | **61% fewer** |
| Balanced | 51 | 35.0 KB | ~8,948 | **25% fewer** |
| Full | 69 | 46.9 KB | ~12,001 | baseline |

**Example:** Using Zed with Minimal preset saves **7,315 tokens** (61%) compared to Full preset!

### Backwards Compatibility

✅ **100% backwards compatible** with v1.0.2:
- All CLI flags work exactly the same
- All 69 tools available by default (no config needed)
- No breaking changes to MCP protocol
- Existing integrations continue working unchanged
- Configuration is completely optional

**Migration Path:** No changes required! See [MIGRATION.md](docs/MIGRATION.md) for optional enhancements.

### Fixed

- **Import graph duplicates** (B2): Deduplicated file paths in `get_import_graph` - each file is now processed only once regardless of symbol count
- **License detection for transitive dependencies** (B3): Added `parse_cargo_lock()` to extract all transitive dependencies with license info; `parse_dependencies()` now prefers Cargo.lock over Cargo.toml
- **Call graph fuzzy function matching** (B5): Applied `find_function()` fuzzy matching in `to_markdown()` and `get_metrics()` - "scan_repository" now correctly finds "CodeIntelEngine::scan_repository"
- **Initialization test timeout** (CI): Increased threshold from 500ms to 1000ms for cross-platform CI stability
- Fixed config.preset being ignored in ToolFilter (production bug)
- Fixed unused import warnings in `src/tool_handlers/mod.rs` and config modules

## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-23

### Security

- **Fixed 7 path traversal vulnerabilities** (CWE-22) in the following functions:
  - `trace_taint` - taint analysis endpoint
  - `suggest_fix` - security fix suggestions
  - `get_export_map` - module export analysis
  - `find_semantic_clones` - code clone detection
  - `infer_types` - type inference
  - `check_type_errors` - type error checking
  - `get_typed_taint_flow` - typed taint flow analysis

  All path inputs are now validated using `validate_path()` which performs
  canonicalization and ensures paths stay within the repository root.

### Changed

- Split `neural` feature into two separate features:
  - `neural` - TF-IDF vector search and API-based embeddings (stable)
  - `neural-onnx` - Local ONNX model inference (experimental, requires ort 2.0)
- Updated ort dependency to 2.0.0-rc.10 with new API compatibility

### Fixed

- Fixed compilation issues with ort 2.0.0-rc.10 API changes:
  - Updated `OnnxEmbedder` to use `Mutex<Session>` for thread-safe inference
  - Fixed `try_extract_tensor` return type handling (now returns `(Shape, &[T])`)
  - Removed deprecated `tensor_dimensions()` call
  - Fixed `TensorRef::from_array_view` to take owned view instead of reference
- Fixed usearch save/load to use string paths instead of Path references
- Added missing `neural_config` field to test configurations
- Fixed integration test `test_error_invalid_json` that could hang indefinitely
  - The test now correctly handles JSON-RPC 2.0 spec behavior for malformed input

### Added

- **Test file detection for security scanning**: Added `is_test_file()` function
  that detects test files across languages (Rust, JS/TS, Python, Go, Java)
- **`exclude_tests` parameter for `scan_security`**: Security scans now exclude
  test files by default, reducing false positives from intentional vulnerable
  test fixtures. Set `exclude_tests: false` to include test files.
